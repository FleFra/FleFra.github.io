                    <p>
                        "Foul Fiasco" is a 2D game developed in Unity for a school project where we had to create an arcade game with a team of 5 people.
                        For this project, each team had different restrictions. Our team had to make a game for kids under 12 in greyscale, 
                        with the theme 'Sports'. We decided to make a game where you're running away from the referee of a football game, 
                        while simultaneously dodging obstacles and scoring goals for extra points. The game has simple mechanics and an online leaderboard.

                <h2>My Contribution</h2>
                <p>During the development of foul fiasco, I worked on the following key-features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pixel art:</strong> I created most of the art in foul fiasco. It was quite difficult to make a greyscale game, since the risk of the game looking washed out was very prominent. I chose to make the background very light so the character and obstacles would 'pop' more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Made sure all the animations played at the right time and worked properly in the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Mainly focused on random map generation and movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project was very fun, our team worked well and we we're proud of the game we made in such a short timeframe.</p>
